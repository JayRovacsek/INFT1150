<div id= "main">
	<h2> can put some sort of writing here for main page after u login </h2>
	<p> this is under the main div <p>
	<p>obvs not even close to finishing, i have to make those links clickable <br>
		fix up all the writing and layout of the writing, most likely change the <br>
		background picture so its eaier to read the writing, or put the writing <br>
		in boxes. <br>
		and none of the links, or tabs are set in concrete, just examples to get <br>
		a rough idea on how to create the hover tabs etc. <br> <br>
		made a logo, can be easily changed too, and turned into <br> a home button to be rid of the home tab.
